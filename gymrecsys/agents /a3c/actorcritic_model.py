    """A3C Model

        This class is for the policy and value approximator model for the A3C
        Both the master and the all the workers use individual instances of the same model class.

        This variant of the model class extends the keras.model and use tf.Model Sub-Classing feature.

        In a sub-class(ed) model, advanced features like shared network, shared inputs and residual networks could
        be easily implemented. The network layers need to defined in the __init__() method, and then their connection
        as required in the forward pass needs to be defined in the call or __call__ method.

        TensorFlow eager execution needs to be enabled for this to work as desired.
